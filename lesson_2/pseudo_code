1)
Given two numbers.
  - Set each number to a variable.
  - Set variable result to the sum of both variables
  - Return the the variable result.

START

# Write a method that returns the sum of two integers

SET first number = number1 as integer
SET second number = number2 as integer
SET result = number1 + number2

PRINT result

END

2)
Given an array of strings.
  - Create an empty string.
  - Set empty string to variable new string.
Iterate through the array one by one.
  - For each iteration concatenate with the new string.
After iterating through the array, return the new string.


START

# Write a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

SET new_string = ""
FOR each string in the array
  SET new_string = new_string + string

PRINT new_string

END

3)
Given an array of integers.
  - Create a new array.
For each integer.
  - If integer position is odd
  - Add integer to the new array.

START

# Write a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

SET new_array = []
SET iterator = 0
FOR i / 2 even?
SET new_array += integer

PRINT new_array

END
